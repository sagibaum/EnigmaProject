# EnigmaProject
Enigma machine implementation, including automatic decipher process (using brute force).

Project characteristics: 
1) The machine implementation created base on (XML) file and is a generic one, not limited to a certain scale and have the ability to encrypt various letters.
2) The project architecture includes console, desktop and client-server apps (based on HTTP using tomcat platform).
3) The decryption/encryption process involved working with multiple threads, files, collections and other OOP concepts and principles
   (e.g. interfaces, encapsulation,inheritance etc ).
4) The project uses external Libraries like ok-HTTP, J-Son To support communication between the various applications and the server, by HTTP requests,
   and in combinatorics library for decryption process .
   
How run the game ? 
1) Download a tomcat server.
2) Download the "Game file".
3) Implement the "Server.war" file in the tomcat server. 
4) Run one of the following files(from cmd or just double click) : 
  a) to play an ally -> press on the allies.bat file. 
  b) to play an uboat -> press on the uboat.bat file.
